**Security: DONE**
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Use environment variables or a configuration file.
- Implement password hashing and salting for enhanced security.

**Error Handling:**
- Implement proper error handling for database operations. Return appropriate HTTP status codes and meaningful error messages to the client.

**Validation and Sanitization:**
- Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against security vulnerabilities.
- Validate user inputs (e.g., username, password) before processing them in the database.

**Database Connection Pooling:**
- Consider using a connection pool for MySQL connections to improve performance and handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

**Session Management:**
- Configure session options based on your application's requirements. Set specific cookie expiration time, use secure cookies for HTTPS, and choose an appropriate session store.

**Middleware:**
- Use middleware for common functionalities like authentication and authorization to keep route handlers clean and focused.

**Logging:**
- Use a logging library (e.g., Winston, Morgan) for advanced logging capabilities.

**Code Structure:**
- Group related functionalities together. Consider organizing database operations in a separate module and using separate files for handling routes.

**Error Responses:**
- Provide meaningful error messages in the responses to help clients understand and handle errors appropriately.

**Testing:**
- Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.

**Documentation:**
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-intuitive behavior for easier understanding and maintenance.

**Future Considerations:**
- Implement user authentication and authorization if needed.
- Add validation for request payloads to ensure they have required fields and valid formats.
- Implement logging and monitoring for tracking application behavior and performance in production environments.
